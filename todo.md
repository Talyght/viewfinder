# Welcome to  Viewfinder's To-Do list


## Pritoritary

### Implement a "data detection" module 
in order to detect and properly visualize the numerical data based on its format and type, for example, having data properly represented as boxplots, histograms and other graphs by recognizing the data type and which visualization type it is compatible with, so far Viewfinder takes whatever numerical input is has and just renders a histogram.

### Extend the exportData function to add an "export to PDF" 
I'm not very happy with the state of the exportData function at the moment my idea is to revamp it so that is produces a full report of the visualizations and datatypes as PDF which I believe could be more useful

## would be nice

Perhaps rafactoring viewfinder to a more modular architecture could be better for the long term development of the project, but so far it is working.
